This is by far and away one of my top movies of all time and definitely a movie that I can say the lines pretty much the whole way through.After thinking about "what I was disappointed with", I would say the following:. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you "don't know that you're missing till it's gone". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the "less projecting voices" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing "broadway aspect" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie "a whole package" was just not there.Did not feel the same about Aladdin remake another movie that was with huge shoes to fill (duh, robin williams) and the Aladdin remake was absolutely fantastic.
